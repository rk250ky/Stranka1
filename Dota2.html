            <div class="text text-2560">
                Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve.
                The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard
                Entertainment's Warcraft III:
                Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams
                of five players,
                with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players
                independently controls a powerful
                character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play.
                During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the
                opposing team's
                heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's
                "Ancient", a large structure
                located within their base.

            <div class="text text-2560">
                Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of Defense of the Ancients, was hired by
                Valve to create a modernized remake for them in the Source game engine. It was officially released for
                Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux-based personal computers via the digital distribution platform Steam
                in July 2013, following a Windows-only open beta phase that began two years prior. The game is fully
                free-to-play with no heroes or any other gameplay element needing to be bought or otherwise unlocked. To
                maintain it, Valve supports the game as a service, offering loot boxes and a battle pass subscription
                system called Dota Plus that offer non-gameplay altering virtual goods in return, such as hero cosmetics
                and audio replacement packs. The game has also been updated with various other features since release,
                such as a port to the Source 2 engine and support for virtual reality.

            <div class="text text-2560">
                Dota 2 has a large esports scene, with teams from around the world playing in various professional
                leagues and tournaments. Valve manages an event format known as the Dota Pro Circuit, which are a series
                of tournaments that award qualification points for earning direct invitations to The International, the
                game's premier annual tournament. Internationals feature a crowdfunded prize money system that has seen
                amounts in upwards of US$30 million, making Dota 2 the most lucrative game in esports. Media coverage of
                most tournaments is done by a selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the
                ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events. In addition to playing matches to a live
                audience in arenas and stadiums, broadcasts of them are also streamed live over the internet, and
                sometimes simulcast on television networks, with peak viewership numbers in the millions.

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <div class="text text-2560">
                Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players compete
                to collectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient", whilst
                defending their own. As in Defense of the Ancients, the game is controlled using standard real-time
                strategy controls, and is presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric perspective. Ten
                players each control one of the game's 119 playable characters, known as "heroes", with each having
                their own design, strengths, and weaknesses. Heroes are divided into two primary roles, known as the
                core and support. Cores, which are also called carries, begin each match as weak and vulnerable, but are
                able to become more powerful later in the game, thus becoming able to "carry" their team to victory.
                Supports generally lack abilities that deal heavy damage, instead having ones with more functionality
                and utility that provide assistance for their cores, such as providing healing and other buffs. Players
                select their hero during a pre-game drafting phase, where they can also discuss potential strategies and
                hero matchups with their teammates. Heroes are removed from the drafting pool and become unavailable for
                all other players once one is selected, and can not be changed once the drafting phase is over.

                All heroes have a basic attack in addition to powerful abilities, which are the primary method of
                fighting. Each hero has at least four of them, all of which are unique. Heroes begin each game with an
                experience level of one, only having access to one of their abilities, but are able to level up and
                become more powerful during the course of the game, up to a maximum level of 30. Whenever a hero gains
                an experience level, the player is able to unlock another of their abilities or improve one already
                learned. The most powerful ability for each hero is known as their "ultimate", which requires them to
                have an experience level of six in order to use.

            <div class="text text-2560">
                In June 2015, Valve announced that the entirety of Dota 2 would be ported over to their Source 2 game
                engine in an update called Dota 2 Reborn. Reborn was first released as an opt-in beta update that same
                month, and officially replaced the original client in September 2015, making it the first game to use
                the engine. Reborn included a new user interface framework design, ability for custom game modes created
                by the community, and the full replacement of the original Source engine with Source 2. Largely
                attributed to technical difficulties players experienced with the update, the global player base
                experienced a sharp drop of approximately sixteen percent the month following the release of it.
                However, after various updates and patches, over a million concurrent players were playing again by the
                beginning of 2016, with that number being the largest in nearly a year. The move to Source 2 also
                allowed the use of the Vulkan graphics API, which was released as an optional feature in May 2016,
                making Dota 2 one of the first games to offer it.

            <div class="text text-2560">
                Dota 2 was first made available to the public at Gamescom in 2011, coinciding with the inaugural
                International championship, the game's premier esport tournament event. At the event, Valve began
                sending out closed beta invitations to DotA players and attendees for the Microsoft Windows version of
                the game. Although the game was originally meant to publicly release in 2012.
