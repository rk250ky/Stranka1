    <h1>Counter Strike : Global Offensive</h1>
    <div class="text text-2560">
        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Valve and Hidden
        Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series and was released for Windows, OS X, Xbox
        360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, while the Linux version was released in 2014.

    <div class="text text-2560">
        The game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. Both sides are tasked
        with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives. The Terrorists, depending on the game
        mode, must either plant the bomb or defend the hostages, while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the
        bomb from being planted, defuse the bomb, or rescue the hostages. There are nine game modes, all of which have
        distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows players to
        play on dedicated Valve servers, as well as allowing members of the community to host their own servers with
        custom maps and game modes. A battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in 2018.

        Global Offensive received positive reviews from critics on release, who praised for its gameplay and
        faithfulness to predecessors, though it was criticized for some of its early features and was noted for
        differences between the console and PC versions. Since its release, it has drawn in an estimated 11 million
        players per month, and has gathered an active competitive scene, with many tournaments sponsored by Valve
        themselves. In December 2018, Valve transitioned the game to a free-to-play model, focusing on revenue from
        cosmetic items.

    <h1>Gameplay</h1>

    <div class="text text-2560">
        Global Offensive, like prior games in the Counter-Strike series, is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person
        shooter. Two opposing teams, known as the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists, compete in game modes to
        complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb and rescuing or guarding hostages.At
        the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend
        on other weapons or utility in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds rewards more money than losing does, and
        completing objectives such as killing enemies gives cash bonuses. Uncooperative actions, such as killing
        teammates, results in a penalty.

        There are five categories of purchasable weapons, four being guns and the final being utilities: rifles,
        sub-machine guns (SMGs), heavy, pistols, and grenades. All guns have different properties and all grenade types
        have different in-game effects. The hand grenade (HE) deals damage in a small radius, the smoke grenade
        temporarily places a smoke screen, the decoy grenade emulates the player's primary gun, the flashbang
        temporarily blinds players who look towards it when it explodes, and the Molotov cocktail and Incendiary Grenade
        set a small part of the map on fire for a short period of time. Alongside all of the main weapons, the Zeus x27,
        a taser, can also be purchased.
