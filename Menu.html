            eSports describes the world of competitive, organized video gaming.
            Competitors from different leagues or teams face off in the same games that are popular with at-home
            gamers.
            These gamers are watched and followed by millions of fans all over the world, who attend live events or
            tune
            in
            on TV or online.
            Streaming services like Twitch allow viewers to watch as their favorite gamers play in real time, and
            this
            is
            typically where popular gamers build up their fandoms.

            Short answer? A lot of people. According to a report from Newzoo, a market analytics company, 380
            million people
            worldwide will watch eSports this year, including 165 million eSports enthusiasts (a term that describes
            frequent viewers, as opposed to occasional viewers). The bulk of these enthusiasts watch from North
            America,
            China and South Korea.
            Tournaments and other events can attract viewing crowds that rival most traditional professional sports
            outings.
            The 2017 League of Legends World Championship drew more than 80 million viewers, making it one of the
            most
            popular eSports competitions ever. In July, ESPN and Disney XD announced they secured a multi-year deal
            to
            broadcast the Overwatch League, a brand-new international league with 12 franchises centered around the
            incredibly popular multiplayer first-person shooter came, Overwatch.
            According to research from Newzoo, 588 major esports events were held in 2017.

            As hard as it may be to imagine for devotees of traditional sports leagues like the NFL or the NBA;
            eSports, at
            its highest levels, functions in a similar way. In fact, this April, the NBA held a draft for the launch
            of its
            new eSports league centered around the basketball-themed NBA 2K game franchise. During the draft, 102
            professional eSports players were selected, with all of the pomp and circumstance normally reserved for
            players
            on the court.

            Colleges have even gotten in on the action. More than 50 colleges have varsity eSports programs,
            recognized by a
            governing body called the National Association of Collegiate Esports. NACE championships dole out
            thousands of
            dollars in prize money, which is put towards scholarships for the winners.
